[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Leonard-P/orbitronics_research_project/blob/main/notebooks/run_simulations.ipynb)

* numerically solve von-Neumann equation for 2D Lattices
* supports Hamiltonians of shape $H_{\rm hop} + E(t) \cdot H_{\rm onsite}$
* $H_{\rm hop}$ has non-zero matrix elements for hoppings along lattice with square/brickwall/hexagonal cells with constant energy $t_{\rm hop}$
